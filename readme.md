# Deadline

Deadline is a simple theme that is designed to be easily hacked into a real theme.

Copy deadline/ into your themes folder and start hacking!

## Motivation

Most wordpress starter/hacking themes try to do too much. They have some something that gets in the way - be that too much out-of-the-box compatibility with 3rd party plugins, a CSS styling framework you may not like, or just something else that makes building a decent site much harder than it should be.

This theme doesn't stick you with any bad technological decisions - because it doesn't make any! All deadline does is:

1. Provide a minimalist CSS reset
2. Provide basic styles for post content based on the CSS reset
3. Render WordPress exclusively using semantic HTML - NO DIVs (grep the codebase, I dare ya!)

Nothing else. You'll find that 80% of the time, all you'll need to do is write some CSS.

Remember: you're not configuring a theme, you're writing one! To serve the purpose of being a theme for hacking, deadline is less than 350 SLOC & 5 source files (with one existing to import two of the others). You have a deadline to make, so you don't have time to learn a theme's peculiarities.
